# Connectors Explained

Connectors are standard proxy logic contracts that let DeFi Smart Accounts \(DSAs\) interact with various smart contracts and make necessary actions like cross-protocol interoperability accessible.

DSAs are powerful because connectors extend their functionality. Every new connector added is immediately usable by any developer building on top of DSAs. Connectors can either be base connectors to protocols, auth connectors, higher-level connectors with more specific use cases like optimized lending, or connectors to native liquidity pools.

You can create a pull request to request support for specific protocol or external contracts. You can also contribute by adding connectors yourself.
